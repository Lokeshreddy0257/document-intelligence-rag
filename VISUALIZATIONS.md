# 📊 Visualization Features

## Overview

The Document Intelligence RAG System now includes comprehensive visualizations and analytics to help you understand system performance, document usage, and query patterns.

## 🎨 Visualization Components

### 1. **Metrics Dashboard** 
Real-time metrics displayed at the top of the chat interface:
- 📚 **Total Documents**: Number of uploaded PDFs
- 🔍 **Total Chunks**: Number of indexed text chunks
- 💬 **Queries Answered**: Total questions processed
- ⚡ **Avg Response Time**: Average query processing time

### 2. **Document Distribution Chart** (Pie Chart)
- Shows how text chunks are distributed across uploaded documents
- Interactive hover to see exact chunk counts
- Color-coded for easy identification
- Helps identify which documents contribute most to the knowledge base

### 3. **Query Performance Chart** (Bar Chart)
- Displays response time for each query
- Color gradient indicates performance (green = fast, red = slow)
- Helps identify performance bottlenecks
- Track system efficiency over time

### 4. **Query Timeline** (Line Chart)
- Shows number of sources used per query over time
- Interactive markers for each query
- Helps understand retrieval patterns
- Identifies queries that required more context

### 5. **Question Word Cloud**
- Visual representation of most common words in queries
- Larger words = more frequently used
- Helps identify common topics and patterns
- Great for understanding user interests

### 6. **Response Time Gauge** (Coming Soon)
- Real-time performance indicator
- Shows if system is meeting target response times
- Visual feedback on system health

### 7. **Upload History Table**
- Chronological list of all uploaded documents
- Shows timestamp and chunk count for each upload
- Sortable and filterable
- Track document ingestion over time
